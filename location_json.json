Countless gallons and kilos of coffee later, and they had their first and still most popular blend, Cafe Creme . Cafe Espresso soon followed, and from there Cafe Milano, and Cafe Roma, Superiore and San Marco, the ever evolving and growing Ponticelli\u00ae range soon grew a reputation for quality coffee, produced locally.

  "description": "We source our green coffee through the most respected merchants in the trade whose ethos is to ensure a fair return for the grower, that coffee is produced in a sustainable way and where workers are properly compensated. We use high quality, traceable beans sourced in small lots, primarily from South America and East Africa, each batch being carefully selected to display the characteristics of the region. These are then hand roasted at our premises. The Zen ethos is to help people step aside the hurly burly of modern life and allow themselves a moment to connect with their own energy. Coffee doesn\u2019t just stimulate the mind and tastebuds, its an antioxidant too. So in small amounts its good for both your mind and your health. More than that it provides a simple excuse to relax, be that be at the end of a meal or as a brief interlude, either alone or in company. So please make the most of Zen and in so doing we hope to help you make a small step in your journey to make the most of you!",
